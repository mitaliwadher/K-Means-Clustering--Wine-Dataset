########## Wine Data Set Information############

#These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines 
#grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivators.

#The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents 
#found in each of the three types of wines.
#Number of samples : 178
#Dataset Attributes:

#1) Alcohol
#2) Malic acid
#3) Ash
#4) Alcalinity of ash
#5) Magnesium
#6) Total phenols
#7) Flavanoids
#8) Nonflavanoid phenols
#9) Proanthocyanins
#10) Color intensity
#11) Hue
#12) OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
#13) Proline
